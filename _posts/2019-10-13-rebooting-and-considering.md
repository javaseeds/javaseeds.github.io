This page is getting re-worked as I keep learning Jekyll and other items to add.  I hope to have
some samples of some of my musings, things I have learned and am learning.  It's difficult as I have a 5 1/2 month old that keeps me on my toes these days on top of all the challenges at work.

But in the coming weeks, I have these articles along with functioning sample code to be published

- How to unit test Validation code 
  - One sample using Micronaut's new validator
  - Another sample using Spring Boot v2.1.x and Hibernate's Validato
- Sample apps for AWS that I've been learning how to do lately
  - DynamoDb, including the very useful LocalDynamoDB
  - Elasticache, specifically Redis, that I started playing with at work with AWS Kinesis Streams
  - Athena queries of S3 buckets for payload analysis.  This one has been quite interesting
- Using Spring Boot and Apache CXF to build a (very simple) SOAP application
- First stab at Webassembly and TeaVM (but probably not until after new year - 2020)
