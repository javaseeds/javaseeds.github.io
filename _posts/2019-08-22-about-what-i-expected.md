Yeah, this endeavor is going about as well as I expected. On top of attempting to learn
Jekyll on Github, I'm trying to do these things as well (at work and home):

- Redis and AWS Elasticache
- Kinesis Streams
- Beewax Bid
- Protocol Buffers
- Docker
- Neo4j
- Linux / Ubuntu
- Regular Expressions
- HTTP/2
